The following models have been discarded and excluded from further analyses, because of violations of distributional assumptions:

- Alnus.incana gdd0_aclim_01 DE_BWI
- Populus.tremula gdd0_aclim_01 SE_NFI
- Salix.caprea gdd0_aclim_01 SE_NFI

This reduces the number of inventoryâ€“species combinations from 57 for both environmental gradients to 57 for cwb, 54 for gdd.
